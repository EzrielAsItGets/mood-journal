# MoodJournal
MoodJournal is a web-based journaling application that uses machine learning through Google's
Cloud Natural Language processing to match the mood of journal writings to music (as available through
Spotify's API). The user interface of this web-application is designed to elicit nostalgia for the 2000s,
where the young people were angry and angsty, and the only outlets were writing in journals and listening
to music. Users will be greeted with a familiar interface furnished with all of the aesthetic fixtures of
contemporary design.
